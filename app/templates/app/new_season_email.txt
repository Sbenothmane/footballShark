It's the start of the season, and that means a clean slate. As a reminder, the lines will be posted on Tuesday morning each week and will lock at the start of the first game each week, usually on Thursday evening. 

Here's the link to make your picks this week:

The link will expire at the start of the game, so be sure to get your picks in by then! Go Bills!

Sincerely,
The Football Shark Team
